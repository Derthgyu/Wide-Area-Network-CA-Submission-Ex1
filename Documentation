EXERCISE 1: Multi-Site WAN Extension with Redundant Paths

1. The goal is to extend the basic linear WAN into a triangular topology with redundancy:
	• HQ (n0) connects to Branch (n1) and DC (n2)
	• Branch (n1) connects to HQ (n0) and DC (n2)
	• DC (n2) connects to HQ (n0) and Branch (n1)
This provides two possible paths between any two sites.
SOLUTION :
Create Additional Links (Link 3: DC)
This snippet must be inserted after the existing link2Devices installation

Code:
// Link3 : n0-n2 (network 3)
NodeCintainer link3Node(n0,n2);
NetDeviceContainer link3Devices = p2p.Install(link3Nodes);

2. Static Routing Table Analysis
Each node must have two routes to the other network:
	• Primary (direct)
	• Backup (via third node)

HQ (n0) routes to DC
staticN0->AddNetworkRouteTo(”10.1.2.0”,”255.255.255.0”,”10.1.3.2”,1); // primary
staticN0->AddNetworkRouteTo(”10.1.2.0”,”255.255.255.0”,”10.1.1.2”,2); // backup via Branch

Explanation
	• If the direct link fails, traffic automatically follows the backup path.
•	 Symmetric routes must also be added on n1 and n2.

3. Path Failure Simulation
Interpretation
Simulate failure of the HQ–DC primary link at t = 4s and verify traffic continues via Branch.

Code:

Simulator::Schedule(Seconds(4.0),
  &Ipv4::SetDown,
  n0->GetObject<Ipv4>(),
  n0->GetObject<Ipv4>()->GetInterfaceForDevice(dev02.Get(0)));

Verification
	• Use NetAnim → traffic shifts path
	• Use FlowMonitor → packets still delivered

4. Scalability Analysis
Interpretation

Static routing does not scale.

For N nodes:
Static routes required = N × (N − 1)
Example:
	• 10 sites → 90 static routes
Scalable Solution
Use dynamic routing (OSPF).

5. Business Continuity Justification
Static routing with redundancy provides:
	• Improved reliability (failover paths)
	• Load-balancing potential
	• Deterministic troubleshooting
	• Lower cost than dynamic protocols in small WANs
